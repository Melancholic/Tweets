Dear <%=@user.name%>! 
Someone, or maybe you, have used this e-mail to register for resource <%= root_url%>. 
If it were not for you, then just ignore this message: no further action is for you.


If you registered yet, you need to confirm this address. To do this, you must go to the link 

 <%= verification_user_url(@user)+"?key="+ @user.verification_key %> 

or enter the following code 

<%= @user.verification_key %>

on the confirmation page <%= verification_user_url(@user)%> , then you will be able to gain access to the main functions projects Tweets.

Thank for your attention. Your Tweets.
