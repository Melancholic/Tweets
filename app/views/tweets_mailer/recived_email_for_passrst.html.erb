<h2>Dear <%=@user.name%>!</h2>
<br>
<p>
In <b><%= @time %></b> server time we had worked out a request to change the password  your account from <b> <%= @host%></b> host.
</p>
<p>
If you did not make such a request, and does not want to change your password, no further action is required from you.
</p>
<p>
If you want to change your password, please go to <%= reset_password_users_url()+"?key="+ @user.reset_password_key %>  and fill the form. The link will be valid for <%=TYME_LIM_PASSRST_KEY%> minutes.
</p>
<p>
With thanks to your Tweets!
